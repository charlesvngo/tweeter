# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Application will be able to accept text inputs and post them to the timeline in real time. Application has both a desktop version (1024px or greater) and a mobile version. 

Stretch goals have been implemented and the application has a tweet-field collapse button on the top right and a scroll to top button on the bottom right of the application. Extra features include focus added to the tweet field after pressing either button and the ability to submit tweets with the "Enter" key.
